## Getting the "correct" Answer
When reviewing/comparing for the correct answer I think its important to consider the sources in a lot of ways. Obvious ways probably include bias. But some other less obvious things is the language. One thing I want this system to do well is work in multiple languages to get answers. Right now best I can tell you get resualts for the language you search in. So if you search about mexico in english you get ai looking at news in english and that automatically adds a lot of bais. Same way if its in arbic or spanish or whatever. Some of the best reporting in the world by aljazeera is just in aribic or english and a spanish searcher right now as practically no access to that through ai.
