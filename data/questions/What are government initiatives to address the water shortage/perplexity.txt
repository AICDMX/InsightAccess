### Government Initiatives to Address Water Shortage in Mexico City and Surrounding Areas

Mexico City is facing a severe water shortage crisis, prompting various government initiatives to tackle this pressing issue. Here are some key initiatives:

1. **'Aqua a tu Casa' Program**:
   - Launched in 2016, this program focuses on solving the drinking water scarcity problem in marginalized areas by installing rainwater harvesting systems and water purification technologies in houses, apartments, and public buildings[1].

2. **Mexico City's Water Fund**:
   - The Nature Conservancy (TNC) has partnered with private initiatives and civil society to create Mexico City's Water Fund. This initiative aims to drive nature-based solutions, improve public policies, and prepare the city for future water challenges exacerbated by climate change and population growth[2].

3. **Government Investment in Water Projects**:
   - The Government of Mexico, through the National Water Commission (Conagua), is investing significantly in fifteen priority water projects with a budget of 93.55 billion pesos. These projects include the construction of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation districts to address drought and water scarcity across various regions of the country[3].

These initiatives underscore the multifaceted approach taken by the government to combat the water shortage crisis in Mexico City and its surrounding areas. By implementing sustainable solutions, investing in infrastructure, and promoting community involvement, Mexico is striving to ensure a more resilient and water-secure future for its residents.
