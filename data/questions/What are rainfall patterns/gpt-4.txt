Mexico City, located in the central part of Mexico, experiences a distinct seasonal pattern in its rainfall, impacting water availability significantly. The city's climate can be classified as subtropical highland due to its elevation of over 2,200 meters above sea level. This geographical position influences its weather patterns, including rainfall distribution throughout the year.

### Rainfall Patterns

The rainfall in Mexico City is highly seasonal, with a marked dry season and a wet season:

- **Dry Season:** Typically runs from November to April. During these months, rainfall is minimal, contributing to water scarcity issues in the city and its surroundings. This period is characterized by clear skies and relatively lower humidity.
  
- **Wet Season:** Occurs from May to October, with the bulk of the annual rainfall. This period can account for as much as 70-80% of the annual precipitation. June, July, and August are usually the wettest months. The rain often comes in the form of heavy showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon or evening.

### Impact on Water Availability

The seasonal rainfall pattern has a profound impact on water availability in Mexico City:

- **Water Scarcity during the Dry Season:** The lack of rainfall in the dry months exacerbates the city's water scarcity issues. Mexico City relies heavily on aquifers and water transported from distant sources. Over-extraction of groundwater has led to sinking of the city and diminished water quality. The dry season puts additional stress on these already strained water resources.
  
- **Water Abundance and Challenges during the Wet Season:** While the wet season replenishes water sources, it also brings challenges. The sudden influx of rainwater can lead to flooding, especially in areas with inadequate drainage systems. Furthermore, the city's water infrastructure struggles to capture and store excess rainwater effectively, missing the opportunity to alleviate water scarcity in the drier months.

### Efforts to Mitigate Water Availability Issues

To address these challenges, Mexico City has been implementing various measures:

- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Initiatives to capture rainwater for reuse are becoming more prevalent. This not only helps in reducing the demand on conventional water sources but also mitigates flooding risks.
  
- **Improving Water Infrastructure:** Investments in improving the city's water distribution system, repairing leaks, and upgrading sewage and drainage systems are ongoing to enhance water efficiency and management.
  
- **Sustainable Water Management Practices:** There is an increasing focus on sustainable practices, such as the treatment and reuse of wastewater, and the implementation of water conservation measures.

These efforts aim to create a more resilient water system that can better withstand the variations in rainfall patterns and ensure a more stable water supply for Mexico City and its surrounding areas.
