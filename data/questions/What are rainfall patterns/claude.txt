Unfortunately I do not have access to detailed monthly rainfall data for Mexico City and surrounding areas. However, I can provide some general information about the region's rainfall patterns and their impact on water availability:

- Mexico City has a subtropical highland climate with a rainy season generally lasting from May through October. Rainfall peaks in July and August with monthly averages around 160mm. The dry season runs from November to April, with monthly rainfall averages below 20mm in the driest months.

- Being located in a high valley at over 2,200 meters elevation surrounded by mountain ranges, CDMX relies heavily on groundwater sources for its water supply. Rainfall in the rainy season, especially flooding from heavy storms, helps recharge the aquifers that feed these groundwater sources.

- However, CDMX struggles with water availability issues during the long dry season when rainfall is minimal. Extensive groundwater pumping has also led to sinking soil and subsidence issues in parts of the city as aquifers become overexploited.

- Climate change projections indicate the region may see decreases in total annual rainfall. More intense rainfall when storms do occur could lead to flooding, while extended periods of drought could further strain water resources. Adaptation measures to capture and store more rainwater are being implemented.

In summary, CDMX's uneven seasonal rainfall distribution, overreliance on aquifers, and climate change impacts are combining to make water availability a pressing issue for residents that may worsen without active management of water resources focused on sustainability. Let me know if you need any clarification or additional details!
