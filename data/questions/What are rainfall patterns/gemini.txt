Here's a breakdown of rainfall patterns in Mexico City (CDMX) and the surrounding area, including how it affects water availability:

**Rainfall Patterns**

* **Distinct Seasons:** CDMX experiences a distinct wet and dry season:
    * **Wet Season (June to October):**   Around 85% of the city's annual rainfall occurs during these months. 
    * **Dry Season (November to May):** Rainfall is very limited.

* **Monthly Rainfall Averages:**
    * **January:** 7.6mm
    * **February:** 5.6mm
    * **March:** 8.3mm

    * **December:** 5.1mm

* **Spatial Variation:**  Rainfall can be slightly higher in areas southwest of the city center due to the influence of nearby mountains.

**Impact on Water Availability**

* **Water Scarcity:** CDMX faces significant water scarcity challenges despite the concentrated wet season. Factors include:
    * **Rapid Population Growth:** The city's population has outpaced the development of water infrastructure.
    * **Leakages:** A significant amount of water is lost due to an aging and leaky distribution system.
    * **Overextraction of Groundwater:** Aquifers that supply the city are being depleted at an unsustainable rate.
    * **Pollution:** Water contamination further reduces the amount of usable water.

**Consequences of Rainfall Patterns**

* **Seasonal Water Shortages:** During the long dry season, many areas face severe water shortages, and rationing is common.
* **Reliance on Distant Water Sources:** The city imports water from distant regions, increasing costs and environmental impact.
* **Flooding Risk:**  The concentrated nature of rainfall in the wet season can lead to localized flooding.

**Solutions and Adaptations**

CDMX is working on various solutions to address its water crisis:

* **Rainwater Harvesting:** Increased efforts to capture and store rainwater.
* **Water Reuse:** Treatment and reuse of wastewater.
* **Leakage Repair:** Modernizing the water distribution system to reduce losses.
* **Water Conservation Awareness:** Campaigns to promote water-saving practices among residents and businesses.
