# Goals

* Build an AI that can **answer questions and make useful predictions** about current and future water availability in CDMX.
* Build a UX thatâ€™s sufficiently **accessible for low-tech users** (DroughtPredictorGPT?)
* Automate and streamline the data sourcing and analysis pipeline to support an **open sourced project community**.
* Generalize the pipeline/tool to be useful for other research (eg food shortages, travel issues, public safety, etc)
* Structure the outputs to be **digestible for GPTs**, eventually personal assistants, etc. 

# Plan

1. **Define Key Questions**

   * Where and when will there be water shortages in CDMX in the next 6 months? 
      * Begin with shorter timeframes and gradually expand the scope.
   * How does upcoming water availability compare to historical averages for specific locations (zip code/address)?
   * What are rainfall patterns (by month/year) and how do they affect water availability?
   * What are government initiatives to address the water shortage?
   * How are candidates in the upcoming election addressing the water crisis?
   * Are there tax breaks for water conservation, and how can citizens access them?

2. **Identify Data Sources**

   * **Rainfall by weather station:** https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/precipitacion-actual-y-acumulada-por-estacion
   * **Agua en tu colonia: [invalid URL removed]:** Indicates water sources for specific neighborhoods 
   * **Research paper APIs:**

   * **Langchain:** Open-source AI tool with broad applications.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**  

   * **Define "effective":** The tool should accurately answer questions and predict current and future water availability in CDMX. 
   * **Benchmarking:** Compare performance to similar tools (e.g., Perplexity: https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Where-and-when-W.aXQ7CuScCAx_BINheYKQ?s=u).

#QUESTIONS
When using the questions found in data a location should be included. I feel like that can be left out of most of the questions without effecting it. By preappending to the question should make it more dynamic. 

Example: For CDMX, Mexico City and the surrounding area.

Full Example: For CDMX, Mexico City and the surrounding area. What are rainfall patterns (by month/year) and how do they affect water availability?
